      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Im a computer science trades student from Helsinki, and I complete my
        studies at Haaga-Helias Pasila campus. In my studies, I specialized in
        software development, and I have completed extensive courses on both
        front-end and back-end programming, as well as databases. In front-end
        development, I have used JavaScript, React and React Native, among
        others. In addition, I have familiarized myself with Reacts libraries,
        such as Material UI and Tailwind CSS. On the back-end side, I have
        focused on Java programming and especially the Spring Boot framework. I
        have developed my database skills using PostgreSQL and MongoDB
        databases. In addition, I have familiarized myself with the use of
        Docker to support software development.

      <h2>Dreams and Goals</h2>
      <p>
        I have learned a lot during my studies, but I am aware that there are
        still plenty of development opportunities. Information technology and
        programming are my passions, and I want to work in a competent team
        where I can learn from more experienced people and expand my own
        competence. My goal is to constantly develop my skills and get to know
        new technologies so that I can grow as a professional and make my own
        contribution to the teams success.
