    <p>
      I have learned a lot during my studies, but I am aware that there are
      still plenty of development opportunities. Information technology and
      programming are my passions, and I want to work in a competent team where
      I can learn from more experienced people and expand my own competence. My
      goal is to constantly develop my skills and get to know new technologies
      so that I can grow as a professional and make my own contribution to the
      teams success.
